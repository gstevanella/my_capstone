    Did you know that Instagram, one of the most celebrated social media platforms for photo, video, and live stream sharing, originally developed in 2010 and was subsequently acquired by Facebook Incorporated, who would later rebrand as Meta (short for Meta Platforms Incorporated)?
    <br></br> Instagram attracts users of all ages, especially teenagers and young adults, and from all countries, predicting to reach 1.5 billion individuals within just a few years. Its features supply a well-defined array of services including photo and video filtering, image enhancing, live broadcasting, and commenting and direct messaging options.<br></br> Instagramâ€™s promise is all about immortalising personal moments and sharing them with friends and family, who can find inspirations in oneâ€™s posts and tags, but also discover new places and emerging trends.

  Did you know that social media stalking is a phenomenon that has been historically dismissed 
  and only recently has started to receive more attention due to studies related to
  the potential correlation between compulsive use of social media and poor sleep patterns.

    Academic studies illustrate how the need for sharing, and sometimes oversharing,

  <div class="modal-body">
Did you know that the great majority of our mobiles relies on lithium-ion batteries? Lithium batteries
are mainly made of lithium cobalt oxide and graphite (carbon). Some batteries use materials such as
 manganese instead; either way, the battery case is made of alluminium.
 Amnesty International invatigated human abuses in the Democratic Republic of Congo around the gobal
 trade in <a href="https://www.amnestyusa.org/reports/this-is-what-we-die-for-human-rights-abuses-in-the-democratic-republic-of-the-congo-power-the-global-trade-in-cobalt/" target="blank_page">cobalt</a>.

  and long-term health damage. And just for $2 or $3 a day..

Based on studies carried out by the World Bank, as the production of newer and more
powerful devices is fastly increasing, the global metal consumption is growing
at an yearly rate of 3% to 5%, meaning that, by 2050, our consumption of minerals
will be higher than in the past 70,000 years. </div>

  <div class="modal-body">
    Li-ion and Li-poly batteries (the ones in our phones, tablets and other small devices) 
    are great to ensure product longevity, however, the incredibly high rate of disposal
    of the products that they power and lack of clear and harmonious regulation on how to 
    manage e-waste translates into significant increase of environmental pollution along 
    with consequences directly related to human health as a result of the toxicity of the
    materials that make the batteries.
    <br> Copper, cobalt, thallium, nickel, and silver, are to be considered among the main
    contributors in terms of both human toxicity and ecological impact.

  <div class="modal-body">
  Did you know that some people are keen to track as much as possible about themselves via
  their digital devices such as phones, watches, home sensors, and laptops in order to find personal patterns and discover things they did not know about themselves? <br></br>
  Some of them would say that they are part of the 'quantified-self' movement, individuals who
  'self-track' themselves. Although many devices do not even ask for permission to track our social media activities,
  they just do it and aggregate the results, sometimes selling them to third parties, others 
  capitalising on the information for either making targeted recommendations or predicting consumers' behaviours.
