  <div class="modal-body">
    Did you know that Instagram, one of the most celebrated social media platforms for photo, video, and live stream sharing, originally developed in 2010 and was subsequently acquired by Facebook Incorporated, who would later rebrand as Meta (short for Meta Platforms Incorporated)?
    <br></br> Instagram attracts users of all ages, especially teenagers and young adults, and from all countries, predicting to reach 1.5 billion individuals within just a few years. Its features supply a well-defined array of services including photo and video filtering, image enhancing, live broadcasting, and commenting and direct messaging options.<br></br> Instagramâ€™s promise is all about immortalising personal moments and sharing them with friends and family, who can find inspirations in oneâ€™s posts and tags, but also discover new places and emerging trends.

  Did you know that social media stalking is a phenomenon that has been historically dismissed

  the potential correlation between compulsive use of social media and poor sleep patterns.

    Academic studies illustrate how the need for sharing, and sometimes oversharing,

  <div class="modal-body">
Did you know that the great majority of our mobiles relies on lithium-ion batteries? Lithium batteries
are mainly made of lithium cobalt oxide and graphite (carbon). Some batteries use materials such as
 manganese instead; either way, the battery case is made of alluminium.
 Amnesty International invatigated human abuses in the Democratic Republic of Congo around the gobal
 trade in <a href="https://www.amnestyusa.org/reports/this-is-what-we-die-for-human-rights-abuses-in-the-democratic-republic-of-the-congo-power-the-global-trade-in-cobalt/" target="blank_page">cobalt</a>. Their findings are shocking and include child labour, fatal mines, unbearable working conditions,
  and long-term health damage. And just for $2 or $3 a day..

  <div class="modal-body">
Based on studies carried out by the World Bank, as the production of newer and more
powerful devices is fastly increasing, the global metal consumption is growing
at an yearly rate of 3% to 5%, meaning that, by 2050, our consumption of minerals
will be higher than in the past 70,000 years. </div>

  <div class="modal-body">
    Li-ion and Li-poly batteries (the ones in our phones, tablets and other small devices) 
    are great to ensure product longevity, however, the incredibly high rate of disposal
    of the products that they power and lack of clear and harmonious regulation on how to 
    manage e-waste translates into significant increase of environmental pollution along 
    with consequences directly related to human health as a result of the toxicity of the
    materials that make the batteries.
    <br> Copper, cobalt, thallium, nickel, and silver, are to be considered among the main
    contributors in terms of both human toxicity and ecological impact.

  <div class="modal-body">
  Did you know that some people are keen to track as much as possible about themselves via
  their digital devices such as phones, watches, home sensors, and laptops in order to find personal patterns and discover things they did not know about themselves? <br></br>
  Some of them would say that they are part of the 'quantified-self' movement, individuals who
  'self-track' themselves. Although many devices do not even ask for permission to track our social media activities,
  they just do it and aggregate the results, sometimes selling them to third parties, others 
  capitalising on the information for either making targeted recommendations or predicting consumers' behaviours.

    <div class="title">#Online videos</div>
    <button data-close-button class="close-button">&times;</button>
  </div>
  <div class="modal-body">
  In simple terms, videos 'travel' from the various data centres to our devices (smartphones, laptops, ipads, etc.) via different types
  of netowrk such as cables, modems, optical fiber, mobile networks; all these components require power, which can be granted through electricity, that typically
  creates a high consumption of resorces and a great production of C02 emissions. <br>
  Did tou know that, based on the Shift Project Research data, in 2018 online video viewing 
  generated more than 300 metric tons of carbon dioxide? To get a better sense of quantities,
  just imagine that 10 hours of high-definition video encompasses more data than all English text on Wikipedia!
  <br>Data traffice is the culptrit for more thatn half of the digital tech global impact.
  Every byte stored or transferred needs large scale and powerful infrastructures, and, ad the end 
  of the second decad of the 2000, videos represented 80% of global data traffic..and it does not seem on its way to decrease..

  <div class="modal-body">
  There's a lot of talking about 'screen-time' and attention deficits, however, little has been done
  to stop the design of those online activities that leverage children's variable reward system,
  which is the exact same mechanism that lies behind gambling addictions. Youngsters'minds, who do not necessarily have 
  a strong self-control yet, might become a fertile territory for developing obsessive behaviours.
